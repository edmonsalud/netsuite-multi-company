## Cost Impact Analysis

### License Requirements
Converting shared accounts to individual users will require additional NetSuite licenses.

**Current Shared Accounts:** 15
**Estimated Individual Users Needed:** 35-45 (assuming 2-3 users per shared account)

| Account Type | Est. Users | License Type | Annual Cost/User | Total Annual Cost |
|--------------|------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Financial (AP/AR/Accountant) | 8-12 | Full User | $999 | $7,992 - $11,988 |
| Warehouse/Operations | 15-20 | Limited User | $499 | $7,485 - $9,980 |
| Service/Integration | 3 | Service Account | $0 | $0 |

**Total Estimated Annual Cost:** $15,477 - $21,968

### ROI Justification
**Cost of Non-Compliance:**
- SOX violation penalties: $50,000 - $5,000,000
- Audit findings remediation: $25,000 - $100,000
- Reputational damage: Incalculable
- Fraud risk with shared credentials: Potentially millions

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ SOX compliance achieved
- ‚úÖ Individual accountability established
- ‚úÖ Fraud risk significantly reduced
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for all transactions
- ‚úÖ Performance tracking enabled

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Process

#### For Each Shared Account:

##### Step 1: Document Current Usage
```sql
-- Run this saved search to identify usage patterns
SELECT
    User,
    Role,
    Last_Login_Date,
    Transaction_Count,
    Record_Types_Accessed
FROM Usage_Audit_Log
WHERE User = '[shared account email]'
    AND Date >= ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -3)
ORDER BY Last_Login_Date DESC;
```

##### Step 2: Create Individual Users
1. Navigate to: Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Users
2. Click "New User"
3. Fill in required fields:
   - Email (primary identifier)
   - First Name, Last Name
   - Department
   - Supervisor
4. Set access level (Full, Limited, etc.)
5. Enable "Require Password Change" on first login
6. Enable MFA requirement

##### Step 3: Assign Roles
1. Clone existing role if appropriate
2. Refine permissions to least privilege
3. Test access in sandbox first
