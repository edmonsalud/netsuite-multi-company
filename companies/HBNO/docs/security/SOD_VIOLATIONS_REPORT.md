   - Surprise audits by external party
   - Mandatory vacation policy (force rotation)
   - Dual approval for high-risk transactions
   ```

5. **Technical Controls Implementation**
   ```
   - Enable NetSuite advanced audit trail
   - Implement SIEM monitoring for privileged access

- [ ] Compensating controls documented
- [ ] Technical controls configured
- [ ] User training completed
- [ ] Internal audit review performed

---

### Phase 5: CONTINUOUS MONITORING (Ongoing)

**Establish ongoing governance:**

1. **Monthly Reviews**
   - Review of high-risk role combinations
   - Failed login attempt analysis
   - Privileged access usage reports
   - Role change audit

2. **Quarterly Certifications**
   - Department manager access recertification
   - External consultant access review
   - Shared account verification (should be zero)
   - Exception approval renewal

3. **Annual Assessments**
   - Comprehensive SOD audit
   - Role definition review and update
   - Control effectiveness testing
   - Third-party penetration testing
   - Disaster recovery / business continuity testing

4. **Metrics and KPIs**
   ```
   Track and report:
   - Number of SOD violations (target: 0)
   - Average time to remediate new violations (target: <7 days)
   - Percentage of users with excessive access (target: <5%)
   - Access recertification completion rate (target: 100%)
   - Number of shared accounts (target: 0)
   - External party access count (target: minimize)

## Appendix A: Detailed User Role Lists

[Already captured in main report above]

---

## Appendix B: SOD Policy Template

### HBNO Segregation of Duties Policy

**Purpose:** To establish controls that prevent fraud and errors by ensuring no single individual has control over all aspects of a critical transaction.

**Scope:** All NetSuite users and all financial and operational processes.

**Policy Statements:**

1. **Incompatible Duties Must Be Separated**
   - Authorization vs. Recording
   - Custody of assets vs. Recording
   - Operational responsibility vs. Oversight

2. **Purchasing and Receiving**
   - Purchase order creation and vendor setup must be separate from receiving
   - Three-way match required: PO, Receipt, Invoice
   - Approval authority based on monetary thresholds

3. **Accounts Payable and Accounting**
   - AP processing separate from GL recording
   - AP separate from vendor master maintenance
   - Payment authorization separate from payment execution

4. **Production and Quality**
   - QC inspectors cannot perform production on same lot
   - Quality engineers cannot inspect their own designs
   - Production cannot approve quality standards

5. **System Administration**
   - Administrators cannot have operational financial roles
   - Developers cannot have production access
   - External parties require time-limited, monitored access

6. **Shared Accounts Prohibited**
   - Every user must have unique credentials
   - Shared credentials result in immediate account termination
   - Service accounts must be monitored and approved quarterly

**Exceptions:**
- Must be documented in writing
- Must be approved by CFO or CTO
- Must include compensating controls
- Must be reviewed quarterly

**Enforcement:**
- Quarterly access recertification
- Annual comprehensive audit
- Disciplinary action for violations

---

## Appendix C: Three-Way Match Workflow

**Purchasing to Payment Process with SOD Controls:**

```
Step 1: Purchase Request
- Requestor: Department manager (any)
- Creates: Purchase requisition in NetSuite
- Approval: Department head (if >$1000)

Step 2: Purchase Order Creation
- Role: Purchasing Manager ONLY
- Validates: Budget availability, approved vendor
- Creates: PO in NetSuite
- Approval: Controller (if >$10K), CFO (if >$50K)

Step 3: Goods Receipt
- Role: Warehouse Manager ONLY (NOT purchasing)
- Validates: PO exists, quantities match, quality acceptable
- Creates: Item Receipt in NetSuite
- Documents: Any discrepancies or damages

Step 4: Invoice Receipt
- Role: AP Specialist ONLY (NOT purchasing or warehouse)
- Validates: Invoice received from vendor
- Creates: Vendor Bill in NetSuite
- System: Auto-matches to PO and Receipt

Step 5: Three-Way Match
- System: Automatically compares PO + Receipt + Invoice
- If matches: Routes to payment queue
- If doesn't match: Holds for AP Specialist investigation
- Approval: Controller for variances >$500

Step 6: Payment Authorization
- Role: Controller ONLY (NOT AP Specialist)
- Reviews: Three-way match, proper approvals
- Authorizes: Payment batch

Step 7: Payment Execution
- Role: Treasury / CFO ONLY (NOT AP or Controller)
- Executes: ACH or check run
- Documents: Payment confirmation

Step 8: GL Recording
- Role: Accountant ONLY (NOT AP Specialist)
- Records: AP accrual and payment transactions
- Reconciles: AP aging to GL

Step 9: Month-End Reconciliation
- Role: Controller ONLY (NOT Accountant)
- Reviews: AP aging, vendor statements, accruals
- Investigates: Any discrepancies
- Signs off: Monthly close checklist
```

**Key SOD Controls in this Workflow:**
- Purchasing ≠ Receiving (Steps 2 & 3)
- Receiving ≠ Invoice entry (Steps 3 & 4)
- AP processing ≠ Payment authorization (Steps 4 & 6)
- Payment authorization ≠ Payment execution (Steps 6 & 7)
- Transaction execution ≠ Reconciliation (Steps 4-9)
