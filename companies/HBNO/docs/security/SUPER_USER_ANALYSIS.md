   - Just-in-time (JIT) access provisioning
   - Session recording for all external access
   - Background checks required for external administrators

3. **Implement SOD Matrix:**

   - Require exception approval for any SOD violations
   - Quarterly SOD compliance audits

**Training & Awareness:**
4. **Security awareness training:**
   - SOD principles and importance
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) best practices
   - Incident reporting procedures
   - Annual refresher training

5. **Access governance:**

## Compliance Impact Assessment

### Regulatory & Audit Risks

| Compliance Framework | Current Status | Risk Level | Findings |
|---------------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | ❌ Non-Compliant | CRITICAL | Administrator access for external parties, no access reviews |
| **ISO 27001** | ❌ Non-Compliant | CRITICAL | Excessive privileged access, no SOD controls |
| **PCI DSS** | ❌ Non-Compliant | HIGH | Administrator access not restricted, no quarterly reviews |
| **GDPR** | ⚠️ At Risk | HIGH | External parties with unrestricted access to customer data |
| **SOX (if applicable)** | ❌ Non-Compliant | CRITICAL | Financial system access lacks SOD controls |
| **HIPAA (if applicable)** | ⚠️ At Risk | MEDIUM | Unrestricted access to potentially sensitive data |

### Audit Findings - Predicted

**Expected audit deficiencies if current state persists:**

1. **Material Weakness**: Lack of segregation of duties in financial processes
2. **Material Weakness**: Administrator access not restricted to IT personnel
3. **Significant Deficiency**: No periodic access reviews documented
4. **Significant Deficiency**: External parties with unrestricted system access
5. **Control Deficiency**: Excessive role assignments without business justification
6. **Control Deficiency**: Shared/generic accounts with privileged access
