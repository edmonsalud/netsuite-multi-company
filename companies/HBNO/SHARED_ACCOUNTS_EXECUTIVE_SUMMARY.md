# HBNO Shared Accounts - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
**Audience:** CFO, Controller, IT Security, External Auditors

---

## The Problem in 60 Seconds

HBNO has **5 shared accounts that are SOX violations** and **2 generic admin accounts** that create critical security risks. These accounts completely destroy the audit trail for financial transactions, making it impossible to identify who processed payments, created journal entries, or modified user permissions.

## Why This Matters

### For CFO/Controller
- **SOX Violation:** Shared financial accounts = material weakness
- **Audit Failure:** External auditors will flag this immediately
- **Fraud Risk:** Cannot detect or investigate financial irregularities
- **Compliance Cost:** Potential regulatory penalties and audit remediation costs

### For IT Security
- **Admin Risk:** Generic admin accounts (netsuite1@, netsuite2@) = unknown access
- **No Accountability:** Cannot identify who made security-critical changes
- **Breach Risk:** Shared passwords are security vulnerabilities
- **Investigation Impossible:** Cannot forensically analyze security incidents

### For External Auditors
- **Audit Trail Broken:** Cannot rely on system logs for transaction attribution
- **Control Deficiency:** Shared accounts indicate weak internal controls
- **Testing Impact:** Will require extensive compensating control testing
- **Opinion Risk:** May impact audit opinion depending on severity and remediation

---

## What Success Looks Like

### After Remediation ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Every user has individual account: firstname.lastname@hbno.com
- ‚úÖ Every transaction traceable to specific person
- ‚úÖ Multi-Factor Authentication on all financial/admin accounts
- ‚úÖ Segregation of Duties enforced (no admin accounts with operational roles)
- ‚úÖ Integration accounts are API-only (no UI login)
- ‚úÖ Automated monitoring detects new shared accounts
- ‚úÖ Quarterly access reviews ensure ongoing compliance

## Quick Action Plan

### Week 1 (This Week)
**Focus:** Financial Shared Accounts (ap@, ar@, accountant@)
1. Interview managers to identify all users of shared accounts
2. Create individual accounts for each person
3. Migrate permissions to individual accounts
4. Export transaction history for last 90 days
5. Deactivate shared accounts
6. Enable MFA on all financial accounts

**Owner:** CFO, Controller, IT Security
**Effort:** 5-7 business days
**Stakeholders:** AP Manager, AR Manager, Accounting Manager

### Week 2 (Next Week)
**Focus:** Generic Admin Accounts (netsuite1@, netsuite2@)
1. Determine if "Eduardo NS" and "Diego Gasaniga" are real people or generic accounts
2. Review 180-day audit logs for all user/role changes
3. Create individual admin accounts (if shared)
4. Remove operational roles from admin accounts (SOD fix)
5. Enable MFA on all admin accounts
6. Implement dual authorization for user/role changes

**Owner:** IT Security, CIO
**Effort:** 3-5 business days
**Risk:** HIGH - These accounts can create/modify users

### Week 3-4
**Focus:** Operational Shared Accounts + Integration Verification
- Fix purchasing@ and regulatory@ accounts (6-8 days)
- Verify integration accounts are API-only (2-4 hours)
- Implement monitoring/alerting (1-2 days)

### Sample Email to CFO

**Subject:** URGENT: NetSuite Shared Account SOX Violations Identified

Dear [CFO Name],

I've completed a security assessment of HBNO's NetSuite user accounts and identified **5 shared accounts that are SOX violations**.

**The Issue:**
Multiple people are sharing single accounts for AP (ap@hbno.com), AR (ar@hbno.com), and accounting (accountant@hbno.com). This completely destroys our audit trail - we cannot identify who processed payments, handled cash receipts, or posted journal entries.

**Business Impact:**
- External auditors will flag this as a material weakness
- We cannot investigate financial discrepancies or potential fraud
- This is a direct SOX compliance violation

**Immediate Action Required:**
We need to remediate the 3 financial accounts THIS WEEK before external auditors discover this issue.

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Fix financial shared accounts (ap@, ar@, accountant@)
- Week 2: Fix generic admin accounts (netsuite1@, netsuite2@)
- Week 3-4: Fix operational accounts and implement monitoring

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks total, Week 1 is most critical

I recommend we brief external auditors on Monday and begin remediation immediately.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can't we just document who uses the shared accounts?**
A: No. SOX requires system-enforced controls, not procedural documentation. The system must prevent shared access to financial data.

**Q: Will this disrupt operations?**
A: Minimal disruption. We'll create individual accounts with same permissions, train users (15 minutes), then deactivate shared accounts. Most users won't notice a difference except logging in with their own credentials.

**Q: How much will this cost?**
A: Primarily internal labor (IT Security + managers). No NetSuite licensing costs - we'll use existing licenses. Estimated 80-120 labor hours across 3-4 weeks.

**Q: What if external auditors find this first?**
A: It will be flagged as a material weakness in internal controls. Better to proactively remediate and show auditors our remediation plan than to have them discover it during audit fieldwork.

**Q: Can integration accounts (like Pipe17) be shared?**
A: Yes, IF they are API-only (no UI login). Integration accounts are acceptable as "service accounts" as long as they cannot be used for interactive login and have proper monitoring.

**Q: Why are "netsuite1@" and "netsuite2@" accounts a problem?**
A: These generic admin accounts have user management authority. We cannot audit who created users, assigned roles, or modified permissions. If "Eduardo NS" or "Diego Gasaniga" are real people, the emails should be their real names. If these are shared accounts, it's a critical security violation.
