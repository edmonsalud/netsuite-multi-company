## Key Findings

### 3 Issues Are TRAINING/DOCUMENTATION Needs (Not Bugs!)

**Issues #54, #55, #56** are standard NetSuite features that users don't understand.

**What They Actually Do:**

**Relationships Tab (#54)**
- Shows vendor contacts (all the people at that vendor)
- Shows transaction history (POs, bills, payments)
- Shows related items purchased from vendor
- **Recommendation:** KEEP IT - Train users, it's actually useful!

**Communication Tab (#55)**
- Has a NOTES section - this is EXACTLY what client needs for "a place to put notes"
- Client doesn't know the Notes subtab exists
- Also has phone call logging, email history
- **Recommendation:** Show users the Notes subtab - solves their need!

**System Info & Time Tracking (#56)**
- System Info = Read-only metadata (when created, by whom, Internal ID)
- Time Tracking = For hourly/consulting vendors (River Supply probably doesn't need)
- **Recommendation:** Hide Time Tracking section, keep System Info for troubleshooting

---

### 1 Issue Requires Business Decision (#53)

**Classification vs Subsidiaries - Can we drop one?**

**The Answer:** Depends if you're using OneWorld (multi-company NetSuite).

**If Single Subsidiary (likely):**
- Subsidiaries field can be HIDDEN
- Classification should be KEPT for vendor categorization

**If Multi-Subsidiary (OneWorld):**
- Subsidiaries is REQUIRED - cannot remove
- Classification is OPTIONAL but recommended
- They serve different purposes - document the difference

**Action Needed:** Check if account is OneWorld, then decide.

---

### 1 Issue Requires Customization (#52)

**Classification should only be editable on Items, not Vendor/Customer**

**The Problem:**
- Classification field appears on Vendor, Customer, AND Item records
- Client wants it ONLY on Items
- Affects multiple record types

**The Solution:**
Create custom entry forms that HIDE Classification on Vendor/Customer forms, but keep it visible on Item forms.

**Effort:** 8-12 hours (most complex of all 5 issues)

---

## Recommended Implementation Sequence

### Week 1: Quick Wins (Documentation)
- Create 3 quick reference guides
- 30-minute training session
- Show users the features they already have
- **Issues Resolved:** #54, #55, #56

### Week 2: Business Decision
- Determine OneWorld status
- Decide on Classification vs Subsidiaries
- Create custom form if hiding Subsidiaries
- **Issue Resolved:** #53

### Week 3: Customization
- Create custom Vendor/Customer forms
- Hide/restrict Classification field
- Test with all user roles
- **Issue Resolved:** #52

## Critical Insight: Communication Tab Solves Client Need!

**Client Said:** "Really just need a place to put notes"

**NetSuite Has:** Communication tab → Notes subtab → Exactly what they need!

**Example Use:**
```
Communication Tab > Notes Subtab > New

Note: "Vendor agreed to NET 45 terms starting 11/1/2025"
Note: "Quality issue on PO-12345 - vendor issuing credit"
Note: "Preferred delivery time: Tuesdays before 2 PM"
```

**This is a 5-minute training issue, not a customization issue!**

---

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Highest Risk Item:** Issue #52 (Classification field restriction)
- Could break existing saved searches
- Could break reports
- Requires testing across all user roles
- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing plan included in action plan

**Lowest Risk Items:** Issues #54, #55, #56 (documentation/training)
- Zero technical risk
- Just need to create documentation
- No system changes required

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Implementation

**Issue #52:** Prevents data confusion, ensures Classification is item-centric
**Issue #53:** Simplifies vendor form, reduces user confusion
**Issues #54, #55, #56:** Users can use existing features effectively, no customization needed

### Investment Required

**Time:** 16-26 hours over 3 weeks
**Cost:** Documentation creation + form customization + training
**ROI:** Reduced user confusion, better data integrity, users empowered to use existing features

## Questions for Client

Before starting implementation, need answers to:

1. **OneWorld Status** (Issue #53)
   - Is this a OneWorld account with multiple subsidiaries?
   - If yes, which subsidiaries exist?

2. **Classification Usage** (Issue #52)
   - Are classifications currently in use on Vendor/Customer records?
   - Are there saved searches that filter by Classification on entities?
   - Will hiding Classification break any existing processes?

3. **Training Preferences** (Issues #54, #55, #56)
   - Live training session or recorded video?
   - Who needs to attend training?
   - When is best time for training?

4. **Form Customization Standards**
   - Are there existing custom forms?
   - Is there a naming convention for custom forms?
   - Should customizations be tested in sandbox first?
