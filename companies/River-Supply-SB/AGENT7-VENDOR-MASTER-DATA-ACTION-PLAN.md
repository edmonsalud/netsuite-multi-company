## River Supply SB UAT Issues Analysis

**Account:** River-Supply-SB (9910981-sb1)
**Date Created:** 2025-10-16
**Agent:** NetSuite Vendor Master Data & Configuration Expert
**Status:** Action Plan - Awaiting Approval

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 5 vendor-related UAT issues reveals a mix of:
- **3 Documentation/Training issues** (#54, #55, #56) - Standard NetSuite fields that need user education
- **1 Field Restriction issue** (#52) - Requires field-level security across multiple record types
- **1 Field Rationalization issue** (#53) - Requires business decision and potential form customization

**Critical Finding:** Issue #52 affects multiple record types (Vendor, Customer, Items) and requires a comprehensive field-level security solution across all entity and item forms.

---

## Issue #52: Classification Field Should Only Be Editable Under Inventory Items

**Issue Type:** CUSTOMIZATION REQUIRED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Complexity:** MODERATE
**Scope:** Multi-Record Type (Vendor, Customer, Item)

### Problem Statement
The Classification field appears on Vendor, Customer, and Item records. Client wants it editable ONLY on Inventory Items, not on entity records (Vendor/Customer).

### Business Impact
- **Risk:** Data inconsistency if users populate Classification on wrong record types
- **Confusion:** Users unsure where to set Classification
- **Data Integrity:** Classification should be item-centric, not entity-centric

### NetSuite Standard Behavior
Classification is a standard NetSuite field that appears on:
- Customer records (for customer categorization)
- Vendor records (for vendor categorization)
- Item records (for item categorization)
- Transaction records (inherited from customer/item)

**Important:** NetSuite treats Classifications as separate lists per record type. A Customer Classification is different from an Item Classification, even if they have the same name.

### Recommended Solution

**Option 1: Field-Level Security (RECOMMENDED)**

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create Custom Role Restrictions**
   - Modify all user roles to RESTRICT field access on entity records
   - Keep field editable on Item records only

2. **Field-Level Security via Custom Forms**
   - **Vendor Forms:** Set Classification field to "Hidden" or "Display" (read-only)
   - **Customer Forms:** Set Classification field to "Hidden" or "Display" (read-only)
   - **Item Forms:** Keep Classification field "Normal" (editable)

3. **Workflow State Machine (Optional Enhancement)**
   - Create workflow that prevents Classification changes on Vendor/Customer after initial save
   - Allow changes only by Administrator role

**Option 2: Remove Field from Entity Forms**

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Custom Form Modifications**
   - Create custom Vendor form with Classification field removed
   - Create custom Customer form with Classification field removed
   - Set as default forms for all users

2. **Ensure Item Forms Keep Classification**
   - All Item forms (Inventory, Non-Inventory, Service) keep Classification visible and editable

### Technical Implementation Details

#### A. Custom Form Creation

**Vendor Standard Entry Form (Custom)**
```
Customization > Forms > Entry Forms > Vendor

1. Customize > New Custom Form
2. Name: "Vendor Standard Entry - River Supply"
3. On "Fields" subtab:
   - Find "Classification" field
   - Set to: HIDDEN
4. Preferred: Yes
5. Save
```

**Customer Standard Entry Form (Custom)**
```
Customization > Forms > Entry Forms > Customer

1. Customize > New Custom Form
2. Name: "Customer Standard Entry - River Supply"
3. On "Fields" subtab:
   - Find "Classification" field
   - Set to: HIDDEN
4. Preferred: Yes
5. Save
```

**Item Forms - Keep Classification Editable**
```
Keep all item forms (Inventory Item, Non-Inventory Item, Service Item)
with Classification field visible and editable.
```

#### B. Role Permission Configuration (If Using Option 1)

For each role that should NOT edit Classification on entities:
```
Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Roles > [ROLE NAME]

1. Permissions Tab > Transactions subtab
2. Find "Vendor" record type
3. Set field-level permission for "Classification": None or View
4. Repeat for "Customer" record type
5. Ensure "Item" record type keeps full edit access
```

#### C. Workflow-Based Restriction (Optional)

**Workflow: Prevent Classification Edit on Vendors**
```javascript
/**
 * @NApiVersion 2.1
 * @NScriptType WorkflowActionScript
 */
define(['N/record', 'N/error'],
    function(record, error) {
        function onAction(context) {
            var currentRecord = context.newRecord;
            var oldRecord = context.oldRecord;

            var newClassification = currentRecord.getValue({
                fieldId: 'custentity_classification' // or standard 'class' field
            });

            var oldClassification = oldRecord.getValue({
                fieldId: 'custentity_classification'
            });

            // If Classification changed and user is not Administrator
            if (newClassification !== oldClassification) {
                var userRole = runtime.getCurrentUser().role;
                if (userRole !== 3) { // 3 = Administrator
                    throw error.create({
                        name: 'CLASSIFICATION_EDIT_RESTRICTED',
                        message: 'Classification can only be edited on Item records, not on Vendor records.'
                    });
                }
            }
        }

        return {
            onAction: onAction
        };
    });
```

### Documentation Requirements

**User Training Document:** "Understanding NetSuite Classification Field"

**Topics to Cover:**
1. What is Classification and why it's item-centric
2. Where to set Classification (Items only)
3. Why it's hidden/restricted on Vendor/Customer forms
4. How to report by Classification
5. Administrator override process (if needed)

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify Classification field is hidden on Vendor form
- [ ] Verify Classification field is hidden on Customer form
- [ ] Verify Classification field is editable on all Item forms
- [ ] Test with different user roles to ensure restrictions apply
- [ ] Verify Administrator can still access field if needed
- [ ] Test saved searches that use Classification filter
- [ ] Verify reports using Classification still work

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert custom forms to standard forms
2. Remove workflow restrictions
3. Remove role permission changes
4. Document reason for rollback

## Issue #53: Vendors - Difference Between Classification and Subsidiaries

**Issue Type:** DOCUMENTATION/TRAINING + BUSINESS DECISION
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Complexity:** LOW

### Problem Statement
Client is confused about the difference between "Classification" and "Subsidiaries" fields on Vendor records. They want to know if one can be dropped.

### NetSuite Standard Explanation

#### Classification Field
**Purpose:** Categorize vendors into logical groupings for reporting and filtering

**Use Cases:**
- Vendor Type (e.g., Supplier, Consultant, Service Provider)
- Vendor Category (e.g., Raw Materials, Packaging, Freight)
- Strategic groupings (e.g., Preferred Vendor, Regional Vendor)

**Example Values:**
- Office Supplies Vendor
- Raw Material Supplier
- Freight Carrier
- Professional Services
- Maintenance & Repair

**Reporting:** Used in financial reports, vendor analysis, spend reports

**Note:** Classification is a CUSTOM field list - you define the values that make sense for your business.

#### Subsidiaries Field
**Purpose:** Define which subsidiary/company a vendor is associated with (multi-company NetSuite accounts only)

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-entity organizations (e.g., parent company with subsidiaries)
- Restricts vendor visibility and usage by subsidiary
- Controls which subsidiaries can transact with specific vendors

**Example Scenario:**
```
Company Structure:
- River Supply Corp (Parent)
  - River Supply East (Subsidiary)
  - River Supply West (Subsidiary)

Vendor "Local Parts Co":
- Subsidiaries: River Supply East only
- Result: Only East subsidiary can create POs with this vendor
```

**Critical:** If you have OneWorld (multi-subsidiary) enabled, Subsidiaries is REQUIRED and cannot be removed.

### Business Decision Required

**Question for Client:** "Is River Supply using NetSuite OneWorld with multiple subsidiaries?"

**If YES (Multi-Subsidiary):**
- **Subsidiaries:** CANNOT be removed - required for multi-entity functionality
- **Classification:** OPTIONAL - but highly recommended for vendor categorization
- **Recommendation:** Keep both, train users on differences

**If NO (Single Entity):**
- **Subsidiaries:** May be hidden if not using multi-entity features
- **Classification:** RECOMMENDED - keep for vendor reporting/categorization
- **Recommendation:** Hide Subsidiaries, keep Classification

### Recommended Solution

#### Scenario A: Single Subsidiary (Most Likely for River Supply)

**Action: Hide Subsidiaries Field**

1. **Custom Form Modification**
   ```
   Customization > Forms > Entry Forms > Vendor
   1. Customize standard Vendor form
   2. Fields subtab > Find "Subsidiaries"
   3. Set to: HIDDEN
   4. Save as "Vendor Standard Entry - River Supply"
   5. Set as Preferred
   ```

2. **Keep Classification Field**
   - Set up Classification list with vendor categories
   - Train users on proper usage
   - Use in reporting and vendor analysis

#### Scenario B: Multi-Subsidiary Account

**Action: Keep Both, Document Differences**

1. **Create Classification Values**
   ```
   Setup > Accounting > Classifications > New

   Suggested values:
   - Office Supplies
   - Raw Materials
   - Packaging Materials
   - Transportation/Freight
   - Professional Services
   - Maintenance/Repair
   - Utilities
   ```

2. **Document Subsidiaries Usage**
   - Create user guide on subsidiary restrictions
   - Train on when to select specific subsidiaries
   - Document multi-entity transaction rules

### Documentation Requirements

**Create Document:** "Vendor Classification vs Subsidiaries - Quick Reference"

**Content:**
```markdown
# Vendor Classification vs Subsidiaries

## Classification (Vendor Category)
**What it does:** Groups vendors by type for reporting
**Example:** "Raw Materials Supplier", "Freight Carrier"
**When to use:** Every vendor should have a classification
**Who sees it:** All users

## Subsidiaries (Company Assignment)
**What it does:** Controls which company can use this vendor
**Example:** "River Supply East" only
**When to use:** Only if you have multiple companies in NetSuite
**Who sees it:** Accounting/Administrators

## Quick Decision Tree
- Need to categorize vendor for reports? → Use Classification
- Need to restrict vendor to specific company? → Use Subsidiaries
- Not sure? → Ask your NetSuite Administrator
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Determine if account is OneWorld (multi-subsidiary)
- [ ] If single subsidiary, verify Subsidiaries field is hidden
- [ ] Verify Classification list is populated with relevant values
- [ ] Test vendor creation with Classification selected
- [ ] Verify reporting by Classification works
- [ ] Test if Subsidiaries restriction works (if multi-entity)

## Issue #54: Vendors - Relationships Tab - What Is This For?

**Issue Type:** DOCUMENTATION/TRAINING
**Priority:** LOW
**Complexity:** LOW

### Problem Statement
Client doesn't understand the purpose of the "Relationships" tab on Vendor records.

### NetSuite Standard Explanation

#### Relationships Tab Purpose
The Relationships tab shows **connected records** and **associated contacts** for a vendor.

**What It Shows:**

1. **Primary Contact**
   - Main point of contact at the vendor
   - Can be selected from Contact records associated with this vendor

2. **Related Contacts**
   - All contact records linked to this vendor
   - Can have multiple contacts (AP contact, sales rep, tech support, etc.)

3. **Related Transactions**
   - Purchase Orders sent to this vendor
   - Bills received from this vendor
   - Payments made to this vendor
   - (View-only - shows transaction history)

4. **Related Records**
   - Items purchased from this vendor
   - Price lists
   - Vendor returns
   - Any custom records linked to vendor

#### Common Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Multiple Vendor Contacts**
```
Vendor: "ABC Supply Co"

Relationships Tab shows:
- John Smith (Purchasing Contact) - Primary
- Jane Doe (Accounts Receivable)
- Bob Johnson (Technical Support)
- Mary Williams (Sales Representative)

Benefit: Quick access to all vendor contacts in one place
```

**Use Case 2: Vendor Transaction History**
```

## Issue #56: Vendors - What Is System Info and Time Tracking?

**Issue Type:** DOCUMENTATION/TRAINING
**Priority:** LOW
**Complexity:** LOW

### Problem Statement
Client doesn't understand the "System Info" and "Time Tracking" sections on Vendor records.

### NetSuite Standard Explanation

#### System Info Tab

**Purpose:** Shows system-generated **metadata** about the vendor record.

**What It Contains:**

1. **Record Information**
   - Internal ID (NetSuite's unique identifier)
   - Date Created
   - Date Last Modified
   - Created By (user name)
   - Last Modified By (user name)

2. **External ID**
   - Used for integrations with external systems
   - Allows external systems to reference this vendor
   - Usually left blank unless using integrations

3. **Custom Fields Section**
   - Any custom fields created by administrators
   - Company-specific fields
   - Integration fields

**Use Cases:**
- Troubleshooting: "When was this vendor created?"
- Audit: "Who last modified this vendor?"
- Integration: "What's the external system ID for this vendor?"
- Support: "What's the Internal ID?" (NetSuite support often asks for this)

#### Time Tracking Section

**Purpose:** Enable/configure **time tracking** for jobs/projects associated with this vendor.

**What It Contains:**

1. **Labor Cost Settings**
   - Default labor cost rates
   - Burden rates (overhead)
   - Cost categories

2. **Time & Billing Settings**
   - Billable vs. non-billable time
   - Time approval rules
   - Project costing settings

**When It's Used:**
- **Professional Services/Consulting vendors** who bill by the hour
- **Subcontractors** on project-based work
- **Job costing** scenarios where you track vendor time on projects

**When It's NOT Used:**
- Standard product/goods vendors (99% of vendors)
- Freight carriers
- Utilities
- Office supply vendors

### Recommended Solution

**Option 1: Hide Time Tracking (RECOMMENDED for River Supply)**

River Supply appears to be a distribution/supply business, not professional services.

**Vendor time tracking is likely NOT NEEDED.**

**Implementation:**
```
Customization > Forms > Entry Forms > Vendor
1. Customize form
2. Find "Time Tracking" section/tab
3. Set to: HIDDEN
4. Save
```

**Option 2: Keep System Info Visible (RECOMMENDED)**

System Info is useful for troubleshooting and auditing.

**Keep Visible** - No customization needed.

**Benefits:**
- Troubleshooting: See when vendor was created
- Audit: Track who made changes
- Support: Quickly find Internal ID for NetSuite support
- Minimal screen space used

**If Client Insists on Hiding System Info:**
```
Customization > Forms > Entry Forms > Vendor
1. Customize form
2. Find "System Info" section
3. Set to: HIDDEN (Not recommended)
4. Save
```

### Documentation Requirements

**Create Quick Reference:** "Understanding Vendor System Info"

**Content:**
```markdown
# Vendor System Info Tab - Quick Guide

## What Is It?
System-generated information about the vendor record.
YOU CANNOT EDIT THIS - NetSuite automatically tracks it.

## What You'll See

### Internal ID
NetSuite's unique number for this vendor.
- Needed when calling NetSuite support
- Used in advanced searches and reports
- Never changes

### Date Created
When this vendor was first added to NetSuite.

### Created By
Which user created this vendor record.

### Date Last Modified
Last time anyone changed this vendor.

### Last Modified By
Which user made the last change.

### External ID
Used for integrations with other systems.
- Usually blank
- Only used if you have integrations
- Don't touch unless IT tells you to

## When To Use System Info

**Troubleshooting:**
"When was this vendor added?" → Check Date Created

**Auditing:**
"Who changed this vendor's terms?" → Check Last Modified By + Date

**NetSuite Support:**
"What's the Internal ID?" → Check System Info

**Integration Issues:**
"What's the external system ID?" → Check External ID

## Time Tracking Section
⚠️ **Most vendors won't use this**

This section is ONLY for:
- Consulting/professional services vendors
- Subcontractors you pay hourly
- Project-based vendor time tracking

If you sell products (not services), you can ignore this section.
It's been hidden from your vendor form.
```

### Training Recommendations

**2-Minute Overview:** "System Info - What You Need to Know"

**Key Talking Points:**
1. System Info is READ-ONLY - you can't change it
2. Use it to see when vendor was created and by whom
3. Use it to find Internal ID for NetSuite support
4. External ID is only for integrations - usually ignore
5. Time Tracking is hidden - you don't need it

**No formal training needed** - include in general vendor form training.
