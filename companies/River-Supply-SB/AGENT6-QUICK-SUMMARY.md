## Critical Questions for Client

**Before proceeding with Issue #51 (Accounting role consolidation):**

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **SOD Compliance:** Have you consulted with your auditors about combining AP + AR into one role?
   - Are you subject to SOX compliance?
   - Do you have internal audit requirements?
   - What are your SOD policies?

2. **Business Impact:** Do you understand that:
   - AP users will gain ability to process customer payments
   - AR users will gain ability to pay vendor bills
   - This may create fraud risk or compliance violations

3. **Alternative Approach:** Would you consider:
   - Keeping AP and AR roles separate for SOD compliance
   - Creating separate "AP Clerk" and "AR Clerk" roles with limited permissions
   - Only combining for senior accounting roles with proper oversight
