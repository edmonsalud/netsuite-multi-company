## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Before Starting

‚úÖ **Role IDs Verified**
- Get actual internal IDs for all roles (Sales Rep, Sales Manager, AR Manager, Accounting, Administrator)
- Required for Issues #27, #28, #29
- Query: `SELECT name, scriptid, id FROM role WHERE isinactive = 'F'`

‚úÖ **Accounting Approval**
- Confirm classification fields (class, dept, location) are/aren't used
- Required for Issue #22
- Get sign-off from Controller or Finance Manager

‚úÖ **Custom Field Inventory**
- List ALL current custom fields on Sales Order
- Required for Issue #32
- Determine desired placement for each

‚úÖ **Test Environment**
- Ideally use sandbox for testing
- If not available, test in production during off-hours
- Prepare rollback plan for each change

### Highest Risk Items

üî¥ **Issue #22 - Classification Removal**
- **Risk:** Breaking accounting/reporting/integrations
- **Mitigation:** MANDATORY discovery before implementation; hide (don't remove) initially

üü° **Issue #23 - Qty Available Column**
- **Risk:** Performance degradation
- **Mitigation:** Start with formula (not script); monitor form load times

üü° **Issues #27 & #29 - Field Security**
- **Risk:** Blocking legitimate business exceptions
- **Mitigation:** Role-based access (not universal lock); document exception process

## Key Decisions Required

### Decision 1: Qty Available Implementation Approach
**Question:** Use formula or script for Qty Available column?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| Formula | Simple, no governance units, fast deployment | Shows snapshot (not real-time), single location only | ‚úÖ START HERE |
| User Event Script | Real-time, multi-location, color coding | Complex, governance units, maintenance | Only if formula insufficient |

**Decision:** Start with formula (Phase 1), upgrade to script only if business requirements demand it.

### Decision 2: Classification Section Handling
**Question:** Hide or completely remove Classification section?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| Hide | Safe, reversible, no data impact | Fields still in database | ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED |
| Remove | Clean, simplified form | Risky if fields are used | Only after thorough discovery |

**Decision:** Hide initially; remove later if confirmed not needed.

### Decision 3: Contact Management Strategy
**Question:** Use standard contacts or transaction-specific field?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|----------------|
| Standard Contacts | Native functionality, no development | Contacts save to customer (permanent) | ‚úÖ If contacts are customer-level |
| Custom Field | Transaction-specific, more control | Extra development, doesn't integrate with contact records | If order-specific contact needed |

**Decision:** Need to ask client: "Should the contact person be saved to the customer master, or is it order-specific only?"
