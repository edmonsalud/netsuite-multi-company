# Agent 4: Employee ID Discovery Report

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Account**: River Supply, Inc. (Sandbox 1)
**Account ID**: 9910981-sb1
**Mission**: Find employee IDs through transaction tables where employees are referenced

---

## Executive Summary

Agent 4 successfully discovered **3 potential employee/user IDs** by querying the `systemNote` table, which tracks user activity across NetSuite records.

---

## Discovered Employee/User IDs

✅ **FOUND 3 UNIQUE USER IDs:**

| User ID | Source Table | Confidence Level |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **3** | systemNote | High (Multiple records) |
| **14** | systemNote | High (Multiple records) |
| **15** | systemNote | High (Multiple records) |

---

## Discovery Method

### Successful Approach: systemNote Table

The `systemNote` table tracks all user activity and record changes in NetSuite. By querying this table, we discovered unique user IDs associated with system activity:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM systemNote WHERE rownum <= 500
```

**Result**: 3 unique user IDs (3, 14, 15)

## Table Analysis

### ✅ Transaction Table
- **Status**: Accessible via SuiteQL
- **Findings**:
  - `transaction.employee` field EXISTS but contains NULL values for all tested records
  - `transaction.createdby` field does NOT exist
  - `transaction.modifiedby` field does NOT exist
- **Conclusion**: Transaction table not useful for employee ID discovery

### ✅ SystemNote Table
- **Status**: Accessible via SuiteQL
- **Findings**:
  - `systemNote.name` field contains user IDs (employees/users who performed actions)
  - Successfully retrieved 500 records from this table
  - Found 3 unique user IDs across all records
- **Conclusion**: ✅ **PRIMARY SOURCE for employee IDs**

---

## SuiteQL Syntax Lessons Learned

### ❌ NOT Supported by NetSuite SuiteQL:
- `LIMIT N` syntax
- `OFFSET N ROWS FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY` syntax (with OFFSET)
- Field aliases in certain contexts

### ✅ SUPPORTED by NetSuite SuiteQL:
- `WHERE rownum <= N` (Oracle-style row limiting)
- `SELECT DISTINCT` (for unique values)
- Basic SELECT with WHERE clauses

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Test these IDs with Employee REST API**: Try querying `/record/v1/employee/{id}` for IDs 3, 14, and 15
2. **Direct SuiteQL employee query**: Try `SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id IN (3, 14, 15)`
3. **Lookup user details**: Query user or entity tables with these IDs

### Example REST API Test:
```javascript
// Test if ID 3 is an employee
GET https://9910981-sb1.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/record/v1/employee/3

// Test if ID 14 is an employee
GET https://9910981-sb1.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/record/v1/employee/14

// Test if ID 15 is an employee
GET https://9910981-sb1.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/record/v1/employee/15
```

## Scripts Created

1. **agent4-suiteql-transactions.js**
   - Initial discovery script testing transaction table queries
   - Multiple test scenarios for finding employee references
   - Identified systemNote table as viable source

2. **agent4-final-report.js**
   - Focused query on systemNote table
   - Used DISTINCT to find all unique user IDs
   - Generated final summary report

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Mission Accomplished**: Agent 4 successfully discovered 3 potential employee IDs (3, 14, 15) by querying the systemNote table for user activity records.

🔍 **Next Agent**: Should test these IDs against the Employee REST API endpoint to confirm they are valid employee records and retrieve employee details.

---

## Technical Details

### Working SuiteQL Query:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM systemNote WHERE rownum <= 500
```

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "items": [
    { "name": "3" },
    { "name": "14" },
    { "name": "15" }
  ],
  "count": 3
}
```

---

**Agent 4 Status**: ✅ Complete
**IDs Discovered**: 3, 14, 15
**Confidence**: High
**Recommended Next Test**: Employee REST API validation
