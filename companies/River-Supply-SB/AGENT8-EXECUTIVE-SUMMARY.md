   - Save

2. **Verify User Permissions** (15 min)
   - Check UAT user's role has:
     - Transactions ‚Üí Inventory Adjustment: **Create** level
     - Lists ‚Üí Accounts: **View** level
     - Lists ‚Üí Items: **View** level

## Next Steps After Configuration Fixed

## Recommended Account Configuration

**Current State:**

**Recommended Long-Term:**
- Create dedicated "Inventory Adjustments" expense account:
  - Type: Other Expense
  - Number: 000-5999-000
  - Name: Inventory Adjustments
  - Purpose: Track all inventory write-offs and adjustments separately
