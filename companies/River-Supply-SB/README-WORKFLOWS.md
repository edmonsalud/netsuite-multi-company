## What the Workflows Do

3. If you change the customer ‚Üí Sales Rep updates automatically
4. You can still manually override if needed

### Technical Details

- **Action:** Set field value using formula `{entity.salesrep}`
- **Field:** STDBODYSALESREP (Sales Rep on transaction)
- **Source:** Customer's default sales rep
- **Logging:** Enabled
- **History:** Tracks all changes

## Important Notes

### Local Validation Will Show Errors

**This is expected and normal:**

```
‚ùå Error: Invalid "field" reference key "STDBODYSALESREP"
```

**Why?** Field definitions only exist in NetSuite, not locally.

**Solution:** Deploy anyway. Errors resolve in NetSuite.

### Workflows Are Simplified

**What's included:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-populate sales rep from customer
- ‚úÖ Update when customer changes
- ‚úÖ Logging enabled
- ‚úÖ History tracking

**What's NOT included (add via NetSuite UI if needed):**
- ‚ùå Conditional logic (only populate if empty)
- ‚ùå Field locking (prevent non-admin edits)
- ‚ùå Notifications

**Why?** These features aren't supported in XML format via SDF. Configure them in NetSuite UI after deployment.

## Testing After Deployment

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Create Estimate:**
   - Transactions ‚Üí Sales ‚Üí Enter Estimates ‚Üí New
   - Select customer "ACME Corp" (or any customer with sales rep)
   - **Expected:** Sales Rep field auto-fills

2. **Change Customer:**
   - Change customer to different one with different rep
   - **Expected:** Sales Rep field updates

3. **Manual Override:**
   - Manually change Sales Rep to different employee
   - Save
   - **Expected:** Manual change persists

4. **Repeat for Sales Order**

### Full Test (30 minutes)

See `WORKFLOW-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` for complete test checklist.

### Workflow Deploys But Doesn't Work

**Check:**

2. Release Status = "Released"
