## üêõ Troubleshooting Test Failures

### Test Failed: No Vendor Bill Created (Test 2)

**Possible Causes**:
1. API keys not configured ‚Üí Check deployment parameters
2. Vendor doesn't exist ‚Üí Create test vendor first
3. PDF extraction failed ‚Üí Check ConvertAPI is working
4. Confidence too low ‚Üí Check fuzzy match results in log

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check "Data Extracted" log entry - is data there?
2. Check "Vendor Match Result" - what's the confidence?
3. Check "Vendor Bill Creation Error" - any error message?

### Test Failed: Cache Not Working (Test 9)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Custom record not deployed ‚Üí Check custom record types
2. Permissions missing ‚Üí Grant Full access to IQ Vendor Cache
3. Cache record not being created ‚Üí Check for save errors in log

**Debug Steps**:
1. Manually create cache record to test permissions
2. Check script log for "Error saving vendor cache"
3. Verify cache TTL parameter is set correctly

### Test Failed: Fuzzy Matching Poor (Test 3)

**Possible Causes**:
1. Vendor names too different ‚Üí May need AI-assisted matching
2. Thresholds too high ‚Üí Lower medium threshold to 0.60
3. Fuzzy matching library not loaded ‚Üí Check file upload

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check log for "Fuzzy Match Result" with breakdown scores
2. Check if `iq_fuzzy_matching_lib.js` exists in File Cabinet
3. Test with vendor names that are more similar
