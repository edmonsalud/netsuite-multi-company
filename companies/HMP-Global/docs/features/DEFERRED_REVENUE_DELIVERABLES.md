# HMP-Global Deferred Revenue Suitelet with JE Integration
## Final Deliverables Summary Report

**Project:** Deferred Revenue Report Enhancement with Journal Entry Integration
**Date Completed:** 2025-10-14
**Development Approach:** Parallel Agent-Based Team Development

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully enhanced the HMP-Global Deferred Revenue Suitelet to include Journal Entry (JE) transactions from GL accounts 25010 and 25020. The project utilized a parallel development approach with 6 specialized NetSuite agents working simultaneously to deliver a comprehensive, production-ready solution with full documentation, testing, and debugging capabilities.

### Key Achievement
The enhanced Suitelet now provides complete visibility into deferred revenue variances by combining:
- Original saved search results (Sales Orders, Invoices, Credit Memos)
- Direct Journal Entry postings to deferred revenue accounts
- Comprehensive drill-down analysis for variance investigation
