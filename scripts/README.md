## Running Scripts on Windows

### Option 1: Git Bash (Recommended)
If you have Git for Windows installed:
```bash
bash ./scripts/deploy-to-company.sh HMP-Global
```

### Option 2: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
```bash
wsl ./scripts/deploy-to-company.sh HMP-Global
```

### Option 3: PowerShell/CMD (Use .bat files instead)
For Windows users without bash, equivalent `.bat` files are available in each company folder:
```cmd
cd companies\HMP-Global
deploy.bat
```

---

## Making Scripts Executable (Linux/Mac)

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

---

## Adding New Scripts

When creating new automation scripts:

1. **Use bash for portability** (works on Linux, Mac, WSL)
2. **Include usage documentation** at the top of the script
3. **Use colors** for better readability (see existing scripts for examples)
4. **Add error handling** (`set -e` for exit on error)
5. **Test with multiple companies** before committing
6. **Document in this README**

---

## Script Conventions

### Error Handling
```bash
set -e  # Exit on error (for critical scripts)
set +e  # Don't exit on error (for validation loops)
```

### Colors
```bash
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color
```

### Company Validation
```bash
if [ ! -d "companies/$COMPANY" ]; then
    echo "Error: Company not found"
    exit 1
fi
```
